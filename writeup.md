## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

The most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to OpenAI labeled data is negative.


## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

The reliability of sentiment labels depends on how clearly the reviews are written. For example, in the first review from the reviews.json file:

"Must admit the taste of O.N.E. coconut water is better. Took a long time to get through the supply of coconut water."

The model predicted this as positive, but a closer reading suggests it should be labeled negative. Even though the language is not overtly harsh, the review implies regret and disappointment, the user prefers another brand and suggests it was difficult to finish the product. This highlights a limitation in the modelâ€™s ability to interpret nuanced sentiment, especially when it relies too heavily on surface-level keywords.
Model hallucinations can introduce the risk of inaccurate sentiment labeling.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

The most common negative sentiment is about the taste, which many users find less enjoyable than competing brands. To improve customer satisfaction, the company should consider reformulating the product for better flavor or introducing flavored options. This shows there is a clear opportunity to improve the product rather than continuing with the current approach. Addressing taste concerns can help the brand gain more loyal customers and compete more effectively in the market.
