I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself.\",\n",
    "            \"I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is \\\"supposedly\\\" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.\",\n",
    "            \"I've tried several different coconut waters and the ZICO tastes the best to me. Use this in my smoothies daily. I was getting this product in the smaller tetra pak, but after opening the package you couldn't shake it up without spilling it. This works much better and I've taken as long as a week to use the 33.8 size with no degradation in taste.\",\n",
    "            \"After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.<br /><br />We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.\",\n",
    "            \"Overall, good taste but still leaves an after taste.<br /><br />Pros: Fast hydration. New flavors (Mango is the best thus far in my opinion). Low calorie.<br /><br />Cons: After taste especially towards the end or if warm. Formula has changed despite what Zico says.\",\n",

    "            \"Even though everyone talks about Natural as the most popular ZICO flavor, this is by far my favorite.  it's light, refreshing and has about 40% less sugar and calories than other flavored coconut waters because ZICO doesn't add juice and puree like the other brands.  By the way, it is also awesome as a mixer (or so i hear).\",\n",

This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic\\\" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.\",\n",

It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste  terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.\",\n",

I give my children coconut water instead of fruit juices because it is so much more nutritious, and we also drink it as a rehydrant when we are ill instead of Gatorade or Pedialyte.  We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids.\",\n",

I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.

I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their \\\"new\\\" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.

Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.
